Hi! I am Archisman, and I am a first-year PhD student at [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk), co-advised by [Peter Scholl](https://pascholl.github.io) and [Diego Aranha](https://dfaranha.github.io). Previously, I was a pre-doctoral researcher at [Trust Lab](https://trustlab.iitb.ac.in) in [IIT Bombay](https://iitb.ac.in), where I was co-advised by [Chethan Kamath](https://cse.iitb.ac.in/~ckamath) and [Sruthi Sekar](https://sruthisekar.wordpress.com). I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from [Ashoka University](https://ashoka.edu.in), where I worked with [Debayan Gupta](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/debayan-gupta).

My research interests are in theoretical and practical aspects of cryptography, specifically multiparty computation and probabilistic proof systems. I am also interested in the hardness of fine-grained primitives, like time-lock puzzles and delay functions.

In my free time, I enjoy reading speculative fiction, singing [Rabindra Sangeet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindra_Sangeet) and tinkering with [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/).
