Hi! I am Archisman, and I am a first-year PhD student at [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk), co-advised by [Peter Scholl](https://pascholl.github.io) and [Diego Aranha](https://dfaranha.github.io). Previously, I was a pre-doctoral researcher at [Trust Lab](https://trustlab.iitb.ac.in) in [IIT Bombay](https://iitb.ac.in), where I was co-advised by [Chethan Kamath](https://cse.iitb.ac.in/~ckamath) and [Sruthi Sekar](https://sruthisekar.wordpress.com). I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from [Ashoka University](https://ashoka.edu.in).

My research interests are in the theoretical and practical aspects of cryptography, specifically multiparty computation and proof systems.
