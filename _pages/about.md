I am currently a predoctoral researcher at [Trust Lab](https://trustlab.iitb.ac.in) in [IIT Bombay](https://iitb.ac.in), where I am jointly advised by [Chethan Kamath](https://cse.iitb.ac.in/~ckamath) and [Sruthi Sekar](https://sruthisekar.wordpress.com). Previously, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from [Ashoka University](https://ashoka.edu.in), where I was mentored by [Debayan Gupta](https://debayangupta.com).

My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical and applied cryptography, and more broadly, digital privacy and security. I am currently working on (a) verifiable delay functions and SNARGs for iterated squaring from groups of unknown order (b) private originator tracing in end-to-end encrypted messaging and (c) function and homomorphic secret sharing for branching and RMS programs.

Earlier, I have also interned at [Questbook](https://www.questbook.app) where I investigated optimizations for web-based zero-knowledge proof generation/verification for the [Reclaim Protocol](https://www.reclaimprotocol.org), and at [Subconscious Compute](https://www.subcom.tech/) where I built a Linux systems hardening wrapper for combining seccomp-BPF syscall filtering with pledge/unveil sandboxing.
